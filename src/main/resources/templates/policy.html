                <p>
                    The purpose of this Privacy Notice is to describe how YourCourse, collects, uses, and shares information about you through our online interfaces (e.g., websites applications) owned and controlled by us.
                    Please read this Privacy Notice carefully to understand what we do.
                    If you do not understand any aspects of our Privacy Notice, please feel free to contact us.

                <p>
                    This Privacy Notice covers information we collect from you through our Site.
                    Some of our Site’s functionality can be used without revealing any Personal Data, but for features or Services related to the Content Offerings, Personal Data is required.
                    In order to access certain features and benefits on our Site, you may need to submit, or we may collect, "Personal Data" (i.e., information that can be used to identify you and which may also be referred to as “personally identifiable information” or “personal information”).
                    Personal Data can include information such as your name, email address, IP address, and device identifier, among other things.
                    You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personal Data you submit to Coursera.
                    Inaccurate information may affect your ability to use the Site, the information you receive when using the Site, and our ability to contact you. For example, your email address should be kept current because that is one of the primary manners in which we communicate with you
                </p>

                    we will undertake a balancing test to ensure that our (or the other party’s) legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of the personal information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may process your personal information in some cases for marketing purposes on the basis of your consent (which you may withdraw at any time as described below).

                    If you withdraw your consent, this may impact the ability for us to provide some of our Services to you.
